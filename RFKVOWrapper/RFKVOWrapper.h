 Adds the given block as the callback for when the keyPath changes. 
 
 The observer does not need to be explicitly removed. It will be removed when the observer or observed object is dealloc'd.

 @param keyPath     The key path to observe.
 @param options     The key-value observing options.
 @param queue       The queue in which the callback block should be performed. Passing nil means the block will be performed in whatever queue the observer callback came in on.
 @param block       The block called when the value at the key path changes.

 @return Returns an identifier that can be used to remove the observer.
